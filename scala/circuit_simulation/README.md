Discrete Event Simulation
=========================

Implementation of a simple simulator for digital circuits.

Copied from the book "Programming in Scala, 2nd Edition", by Martin Odersky,
Lex Spoon and Bill Venners. Presented in chapter 18: "Stateful Objects",
section 18.3: "Case study: Discrete event simulation", from page 367 onwards.

The example in the book is taken from SICP ("Structure and Interpretation of
Computer Programs", by Harlod Abelson and Gerald Jay Sussman), and translated
from Scheme to Scala.
